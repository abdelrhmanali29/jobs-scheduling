# Job Scheduling Microservice

This is a job scheduling microservice built with NestJS, TypeORM, and node-schedule for managing and executing scheduled jobs.

## Features
- Schedule jobs using cron syntax.
- Supports job creation and listing.
- Simple cron-based job scheduling without external databases.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 14.x
- PostgreSQL (for storing job data)

### 6\. API Documentation with Swagger

This project uses **Swagger** for API documentation. You can access the Swagger documentation by navigating to `http://localhost:3015/api-docs` in your browser after starting the application.
Swagger provides an interactive interface to explore and test the API endpoints, making it easier to understand and interact with the API.

# Scaling the Job Scheduling Microservice

## Overview
This job scheduling microservice is designed for managing scheduled tasks and can be scaled horizontally to handle more jobs, API requests, and users across distributed environments.

## Horizontal Scaling
1. **Multiple Instances**:
   - Deploy multiple instances of this microservice behind a load balancer to distribute traffic.
   - Use a stateless design for each instance so they can operate independently. Each instance can handle incoming API requests or perform scheduled tasks.

2. **Distributed Scheduling**:
   - With multiple instances, a single scheduling mechanism is needed to prevent jobs from being executed multiple times across instances.
   - Use a centralized Redis or database-backed job queue (like BullMQ with Redis) to manage job scheduling and task distribution across multiple service instances.
   - Implement leader election to ensure only one instance is responsible for job scheduling.

3. **Database Optimization**:
   - Ensure the PostgreSQL database can handle concurrent connections. Use connection pooling or a managed database service with horizontal scaling options.
   - Shard job data across multiple databases if necessary to reduce bottlenecks.

## API Management and Rate Limiting
1. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse and manage API request spikes effectively.
   - Use a rate-limiting library or API gateway with rate-limiting capabilities.

2. **Caching**:
   - Cache frequently accessed data, such as job status or configurations, using a caching solution like Redis.
   - Reduce database load by caching API responses for specific endpoints that are often requested.

3. **API Gateway**:
   - Deploy an API gateway (like Kong, NGINX, or AWS API Gateway) to manage routing, rate limiting, and authentication for the microservice.
   - The API gateway can also handle SSL termination, monitoring, and logging for all API requests.

## Monitoring and Logging
1. **Centralized Logging**:
   - Use a logging service (like ELK Stack or Grafana Loki) to aggregate logs across instances for monitoring job execution, errors, and other critical events.

2. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Implement health checks and monitoring solutions (e.g., Prometheus with Grafana) to track service health, resource utilization, and performance.
   - Set up alerts to proactively handle issues in the production environment.

## High Availability and Failover
1. **Use a Managed Database with Replication**:
   - Deploy the PostgreSQL database in a high-availability setup with primary-replica configurations to ensure data redundancy and minimize downtime.

2. **Disaster Recovery**:
   - Regularly back up the job data and configurations, allowing for quick recovery in case of data loss or failure.

By following these scaling strategies, the job scheduling microservice can efficiently handle increased load, ensure reliability, and maintain performance across distributed environments.
